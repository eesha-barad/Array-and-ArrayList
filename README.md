# Java Array Functions Project

## Description
This is a Java-based program that performs various operations on an `ArrayList<Integer>`. It demonstrates fundamental array manipulations, algorithmic operations, and the use of Java’s Collection Framework. The program is structured to be modular, making it easy to understand and extend.  

### Features
- Separates even and odd numbers into separate lists.  
- Finds the smallest distance between consecutive numbers in the list.  
- Converts an `ArrayList` to an array and vice versa.  
- Uses efficient algorithms for processing lists.  
- Implements modular programming for better readability and maintenance.

## Project Structure
The project consists of three core Java files:  

- **`ArrayFunctions.java`** → Contains methods for array and list operations.  
- **`UserInput.java`** → Handles user input and stores values in an `ArrayList<Integer>`.  
- **`Main.java`** → The main driver class that runs the program.  

Each file plays a specific role in ensuring the program executes smoothly and performs the required operations efficiently.

## How the Program Works
1. The program prompts the user to enter five integers.  
2. It separates even and odd numbers into different lists and displays them.  
3. It finds the index where the smallest absolute difference occurs between two consecutive numbers.  
4. It demonstrates the conversion of an `ArrayList` to an array and back to an `ArrayList`.

## How to Run
### **Prerequisites**
- Install Java Development Kit (JDK) on your system.  
- Ensure `javac` and `java` commands are available in your terminal.  

### **Steps to Execute**
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.  
2. Compile the Java files using:  
   ```sh
   javac Main.java
3. Run the program using:
   ```sh
   java Main
4. Enter five numbers when prompted.
5. Observe the output based on the program's operations.
